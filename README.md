# Who is IT.LIVE

It is the first Iraqi conference concerned with raising various issues
related to information technology, as this field
has not been addressed across the country through previous conferences and activities, and this is
what our conference
aims to achieve.
What can we look forward to in #IT_Live_2017?
There will be a number of experts in this field discussing different topics, a number of
competitions, entertainment
events and gifts, companies and individuals with experience in this field who will present their
ideas and other
activities that will be announced soon.
When is the conference date?
End of February 2017, dates and times will be announced soon along with the application form for
attendees and speakers.
